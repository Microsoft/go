# The Go Programming Language

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software.

This repository, [microsoft/go](https://github.com/microsoft/go), contains the
infrastructure Microsoft uses to build Go. The submodule named `go` contains the
Go source code. By default, the submodule's remote URL is the official GitHub
mirror of Go, [golang/go](https://github.com/golang/go).  The canonical Git
repository for Go source code is located at https://go.googlesource.com/go.

This project is not involved in producing the [official binary distributions
of Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

Unless otherwise noted, the Go source files are distributed under the
BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.

If you are using this fork and have a Microsoft corporate account, consider
[clicking here to instantly join the Microsoft Go Toolset Announcements email distribution list ðŸ“§](https://idwebelements.microsoft.com/GroupManagement.aspx?Group=golang-announce&Operation=join)
and receive notifications about Microsoft releases of Go and breaking changes.
We also maintain an [internal doc page](https://eng.ms/docs/more/languages-at-microsoft/go/articles/overview).

## Why does this fork exist?

This repository produces a modified version of Go that can be used to build FIPS
140-2 compliant applications. Our goal is to share this implementation with
others in the Go community who have the same requirement, and to merge this
capability into upstream Go as soon as possible. See
[eng/doc/fips](eng/doc/fips) for more information about this feature and the
history of FIPS 140-2 compliance in Go.

The binaries produced by this repository are also intended for general use
within Microsoft instead of the official binary distribution of Go.

We call this repository a fork even though it isn't a traditional Git fork. Its
branches do not share Git ancestry with the Go repository. However, the
repository serves the same purpose as a Git fork: maintaining a modified version
of the Go source code over time.

## Support

This project follows the upstream Go
[Release Policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).
This means we support each major release (1.X) until there are two newer major
releases. A new Go major version is
[released every six months](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle),
so each Go major version is supported for about one year.

When upstream Go releases a new minor version (1.X.Y), we release a
corresponding microsoft/go version that may also include fork-specific changes.
This normally happens once a month. At any time, we may release a new revision
(1.X.Y-Z) to fix an issue without waiting for the next upstream minor release.
Revision releases are uncommon.

Each microsoft/go release is announced in
[a Microsoft-internal email distribution list ðŸ“§](https://idwebelements.microsoft.com/GroupManagement.aspx?Group=golang-announce&Operation=join) and the [Microsoft for Go Developers](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/go/) blog.

## Download and install

We build the forked Go toolset with this list of OS/Arch combinations. To use a
prebuilt copy of Go while targeting a platform that is not on this list,
cross-compilation may be necessary.

* `linux_amd64`
* `linux_armv6l`
* `linux_arm64`
* `windows_amd64`

The following sections list the ways to get a build of the Microsoft fork of Go.

### Docker Container Images

**[microsoft/go-images](https://github.com/microsoft/go-images)** maintains and
documents container images that are available on Microsoft Artifact Registry.

### Azure Linux

The **[Azure Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/azurelinux)** distribution
includes builds of this Go fork.

* In Azure Linux 2.0, the package `msft-golang` installs this fork.
* In Azure Linux 3.0, the `golang` package installs this fork.

### Binary archive

[Completed builds of Go](https://github.com/microsoft/go/blob/microsoft/main/eng/doc/Downloads.md)
for several platforms are available as `zip` and `tar.gz` files.

### Build from source

#### Pre-patched source tarball

[The microsoft/go GitHub releases](https://github.com/microsoft/go/releases)
include a source tarball file ending in `.src.tar.gz`. After downloading and
extracting the tar.gz file, build it using the
[upstream instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install/source).

#### Clone and build

This repository wraps the upstream Go repository and includes build scripts that
automate some aspects of the build process. See [eng/README.md](eng/README.md)
for more details about the infrastructure.

Prerequisites:

* [PowerShell 6+](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
* [Go install from source prerequisites](https://go.dev/doc/install/source)
  * Exception: this repository's build script automatically downloads a
    bootstrap version of Go.

After cloning the repository and checking out the desired tag or commit, use the
following build command:

```
pwsh eng/run.ps1 build -refresh
```

The resulting Go binary can then be found at `go/bin/go`.
