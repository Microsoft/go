# The Go Programming Language

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software.

This repository, https://github.com/microsoft/go, contains the infrastructure
Microsoft uses to build Go. The submodule named `go` contains the Go source
code. By default, the submodule clones the GitHub mirror of Go,
https://github.com/golang/go. The canonical Git repository for Go source code is
located at https://go.googlesource.com/go.

Unless otherwise noted, the Go source files are distributed under the
BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.
