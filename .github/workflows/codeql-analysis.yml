  # Check that the patches apply cleanly as quickly as possible. This means we don't waste machine
  # time running CodeQL setup and analysis when the build can't possibly succeed.

  # This also happens to be a good signal for devs. GitHub Actions is quick to get an agent, so when
  # this job fails, it's easy to see, a nd clear that the rest of the PR's jobs aren't going to
  # succeed. (The actual tests run in AzDO, so we can't cancel them from here, but at least the dev
  # will know the cause of the failures without navigating through the links.)
