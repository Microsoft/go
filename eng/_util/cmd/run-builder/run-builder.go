This command is used in CI to run a build/test/pack configuration.

Example: Build and run tests using the dev scripts:

  eng/run.sh run-builder -builder linux-amd64-devscript

For a list of builders that are run in CI, see 'azure-pipelines.yml'. This
doesn't include every builder that upstream uses. It also adds some builders
that upstream doesn't have.
(See https://github.com/golang/build/blob/master/dashboard/builders.go for a
list of upstream builders.)

CAUTION: Some builders may be destructive! For example, it might set all files
in your repository to read-only.
