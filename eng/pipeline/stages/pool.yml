# This template determines the correct pool names and agent demands based on the current branch and
# AzDO project and passes them into the provided inner stages template.
#
# This is the entrypoint for pool*.yml.
#
# The "public" (vs. internal) and "servicing" (vs. R&D) conditions are evaluated here and then
# passed into an inner template so the values can be reused to determine the pools to use.
#
# The numbered pool templates map parameters to pool names and demands and the reasons behind the
# choices. Each pool*.yml feeds more information into the next one.

parameters:
  # The inner template: { template string, parameters object }
  # Note: the template path is relative to this file (inside "stages/"), not the caller's file path.
