# This pipeline runs rolling builds. This includes inner+outerloop to make sure we have complete
# coverage on each commit that we build.
#
# If we relied on the publish pipeline to run innerloop, commit coverage could be spotty due to
# batching and the long outerloop run time. Also, the publish pipeline is internal, so it would make
# it harder to find results vs. public outerloop runs.
